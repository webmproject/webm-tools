      "message": "I was leaving that for later, or just outright ignoring it; I don\u0027t know what the proper profile is, or if there really is one. Seems like WebM DASH manifests aren\u0027t guaranteed to have sensible values: all three of my test manifests are (apparently) valid. That\u0027s based solely on them working in chrome, though. \n\nAnyway, three valid manifests and two profiles so far:\n\nurn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011\nurn:webm:dash:profile:webm-on-demand:2012\n\nSince I\u0027ve already seen a lack of consistency I\u0027m planning to have the player go by mimetypes and chunk parse results. As long as it can fetch chunks resulting from a manifest parsing run I think the manifest is valid enough for playback.",
