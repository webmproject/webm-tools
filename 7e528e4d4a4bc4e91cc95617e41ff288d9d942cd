The ParseFile method would only be a member of the non-incremental WebMFile abstract. \n\nYou don\u0027t have to do it that way, but you have a few places where you check whether you have an incremental reader -- but such checks would not be necessary in a subclass-specific operation.\n\nWhat you have will work but this class is really doing double-duty.",
