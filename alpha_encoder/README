This is the VP8 Alpha Encoder which can produce VP8 videos with alpha channel
from raw AYUV videos. This is dependent on libvpx being made previously on the
correct level (in ../../).

To convert an avi/vp6a video with alpha into raw ayuv video, use:
  ffmpeg -i <input_file> -f rawvideo -vcodec rawvideo -an -pix_fmt yuva420p raw.out

Make sure to note down the width and height in the output.

Then, you can encode the raw file with VP8 along with the alpha using:
  ./alpha_encoder <width> <height> raw.out vp8alpha.webm
